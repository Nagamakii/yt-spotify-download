Then scroll down to find "Your Library" flip the button to show local files, then either create or use an existing source:

Then, open the main.py file inside your given text editor, and change the "destination" variable to the source folder you used in spotify. Make sure to keep the "r" before the qutation marks otherwise the script will throw a unicode error. Ex:

After that, you can run the script and download the youtube video. 

***An extra tip, if you want to sync these files to other devices, connect them all to the same Wi-Fi network, and open spotify on those devices while you've got the PC you originally created the files on. Give it a moment and it should all sync and you can play the files on the go.***
